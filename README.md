# Fullstack Development Milestone Project – 'Teff' E-commerce (Updated)

# Context

This project focuses on the full-stack development for a mobile-responsive web-based e-commerce website called ‘Teff’. 'Teff' is a purveyor of t-shirts with sleek and modern designs. 

The website has a login feature and requires users to create an account before they are able to check out items for purchase. 

# Demo
The e-commerce website can be found here: https://tsw-teff.herokuapp.com/
The website has been deployed successfully on heroku but currently has a couple of bugs and features that are not working. The source code, however, is available for inspection.

# 2. Technologies Used
* [HTML 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
<br> The project uses HTML5 to structure the content of the website.
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
<br> The project uses CSS to add stylistic touches to the website.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
<br> The project uses Bootstrap to structure the layout of the website (i.e. Navbar, Footer) and ensure website is mobile responsiveness.
* [Django](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
<br> The project uses the Django python Web framework to develop the e-commerce website. 
* [Jinja 2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/)
<br> The project uses Jinja2 to write conditional statements to display content blocks when  certain conditions are met. Additionally, Jinja2 was used to set up template inherritance and extension of html/css files for the project.
<br> The project uses MongoDB Atlas as a cloud database to store user data and file uploads.
* [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
<br> The project uses GoogleFonts to style the typography on the website to enhance the visual experience of users.  
* [FontAwesome 4.7](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/)
<br> The project uses the icons provided by FontAwesome 4.7 alongside call-to-action buttons to enhance the user experience by making user interaction with the application more intuitive. 
* [UploadCare](https://uploadcare.com/) 
<br> The project uses UploadCare to handle the storage and uploads of product photos. As UploadCare is a 'Service as a Product' platform, they provide scalable services should there be an increased traffic to the Teff web-application or should there be a need to increase storage for product image uploads.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) 
<br> The project uses Heroku for the deployment and management of the web application. As Heroku provides timelogs, when an error occurs, it makes easier to identity and remedy bugs.
